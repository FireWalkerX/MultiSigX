          <p class="lead">It is known that the top 500 users (geeks & initial adopters) have 35% of the current supply of coins. The rest  of the 11 million users are always worried about the security of their coins. Here is a solution for you.</p>

          <p class="lead">MultiSigX can also be used for redundancy to protect against loss - with a 2-of-3 address, not only does theft require obtaining 2 different keys, but you can still use the coins if you forget any single key. This allows for more flexible options than just backups.</p>

          <p class="lead">MultiSigX has lots of current and potential usage. Wallet sharing, businesses, contracts, inheritance, increased security and escrow to mention just a few. Increased security with 2FA integrated with Multisig adds a new level of security and protection. MultiSigX is currently used for Bitcoin (BTC) and GreenCoin (XGC).</p>
