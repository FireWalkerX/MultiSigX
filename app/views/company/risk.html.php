One potential weakness with the 2-of-3 address is that it does have 2 of the 3 keys online in the userâ€™s browser at the time of address creation.</p>
<p>Malware that specifically targeted an application using 2-of-3 wallets could lie-in-wait of an address to be created, steal the keys, and then extract the funds later.</p>
<p>However, any wallet, client or server suffers from this problem.</p>
<p>With a 2-of-3 address, the exposure to malware is mostly limited to address creation time, whereas traditional addresses are exposed to this weakness any time you transact.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets (such as <a href="http://www.bitcointrezor.com/" target="_blank">Trezor</a>) may be the best mitigation against this particular attack.</p>
