			<div class="panel-body">
		<p>After signin, you can create a MulitSigX wallet address for
								<ol>
									<li>Self</li>
									<li>Partner</li>
									<li>Friend</li>
									<li>Family</li>
									<li>Employer</li>
									<li>Employee</li>
									<li>Business</li>
									<li>Escrow</li>
									<li>Print / Cold storage</li>
									<li>MultiSigX â€“ self escrow</li>
								</ol>
								</p>
								<p>First the primary account creator defines the users and fills in their emails. Then the system will send a MultiSigX email containing new, 3Sed98r.... (MultiSigX address), their private key and their redeemScript will be sent to their respective emails only.</p>
								<p>The system will not store any of the records on the server except the public keys and redeemScript. When the user deposits funds to the 3Sed98r.... (MultiSigX address) the balance will be seen on the system. The users can now withdraw funds to their respective addresses (old or new) through the user friendly interface, without much knowledge of keys, crypto, createrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction, sendrawtransaction using the bitcoind (daemon) ... </p>
								<p>Simplicity is the key for the user interface. With a click and scan the private key, signatories will be able to complete the deal and send the funds to a specified address.</p>
								<p>When a person initiates the transaction, the other users are intimated with the transaction and asked to validate it and submit / reject the transaction. </p>
								<p><ul>
								<li>A (Business), B (Escrow), C (Programmer). </li>
								<li>A creates a MulitSigX record, System send email to B and C. </li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								
								<p>MultiSigX can be setup to various configurations, such as;
								<ul>
									<li>Either A, B, or C can initiate the payment to C or return to A</li>
									<li>Transaction then requires 1 or 2 more signatures to confirm.</li>

									<li>MultiSigX then sends an email to B and C.</li>
									<li>B and C can check the MultsigX wallet.</li>
									<li>C completes the work.</li>
									<li>If A, is satisfied with the work, B or C can initiate the payment to C.</li>
									<li>If A, is not satisfied with the work, He can request the payment back.</li>
									<li>The pre-arranged amount of signatories agree to the transaction.</li>
									<li>The transaction is made.</li>
								</ul></p>
